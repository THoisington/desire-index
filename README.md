Please do not look too closely at this code. It was mostly an experiment for me with CSS grid and flexbox, and I know that the CSS in particular is kind of messy. 

I was working on this back during the run of desire-index because it was hard me for the keep track of the standings and thought it would be cool to have it referenced somewhere. I was also planning on letting you drag and drop the items on the list so they could use it live on the podcast. However, shortly after I began the Kill Your Babies episode popped up to my dismay.

Anyways, maybe it is still interesting as a record of this segment! I may still clean up the code or add a feature if I feel like it.
